This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-debug issue in React Native: inconsistent rendering within FlatList when dealing with substantial datasets and frequent updates. The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, illustrating how missing or incorrectly displayed items occur without explicit error messages. The solution, provided in `FlatListBugSolution.js`, addresses this issue by implementing efficient data management strategies and optimized rendering techniques.  The solution includes the use of key extractors, data virtualization techniques (if necessary), and careful consideration of component lifecycle methods to ensure data consistency and smooth rendering performance.  This example provides insights into troubleshooting rendering anomalies in React Native and emphasizes the importance of proper data handling within FlatList for large-scale applications.
